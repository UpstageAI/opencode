Read a file or directory from the local filesystem. If the path does not exist, an error is returned.

Usage:
- The filePath parameter should be an absolute path.
- By default, this tool returns up to 2000 lines from the start of the file.
- The offset parameter is the line number to start from (1-indexed).
- To read later sections, call this tool again with a larger offset.
- Use the grep tool to find specific content in large files or files with long lines.
- If you are unsure of the correct file path, use the glob tool to look up filenames by glob pattern.
- Contents are returned with a line prefix.
- Default format: `LINE#ID:<content>` (example: `1#AB:foo`). Use these anchors for hashline edits.
- Legacy format can be restored with `experimental.hashline_edit: false`: `<line>: <content>` (example: `1: foo`).
- For directories, entries are returned one per line (without line numbers) with a trailing `/` for subdirectories.
- Any line longer than 2000 characters is truncated.
- Call this tool in parallel when you know there are multiple files you want to read.
- Avoid tiny repeated slices (30 line chunks). If you need more context, read a larger window.
- This tool can read image files and PDFs and return them as file attachments.
